# My-portfolio

This is my old portfolio site I made around a year ago. It was my first serious attempt at building something real on the web, and honestly — it did its job. Not perfect, but it helped me learn the ropes of React, Vite, and component-based development.

Back then, I was just figuring out the basics and exploring tools like Monstac (kinda), Vite, and plain React. This project isn't flashy — but it was a solid start.

> 🚧 I'm planning to redesign and rebuild this portfolio soon. This one's staying here as a little time capsule.
